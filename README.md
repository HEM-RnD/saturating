# C++ saturating types
C++ header only library for always saturating integral types.

## Description

This library provides the following new integral types:
```
int_sat8_t;
uint_sat8_t;

int_sat16_t;
uint_sat16_t;

int_sat32_t;
uint_sat32_t;

int_sat64_t;
uint_sat64_t;
```
And if 128 bit integers are supported:
```
int_sat128_t;
uint_sat128_t;
```

Custom types can be created using the universal template:

```c++
// Standard declaration: -128, …, 127
typedef xint_sat_t<int8_t> int_sat8_t;

// Custom lower limit: -127, …, 127
typedef xint_sat_t<int8_t, -127> custom1_t;

// Custom limit: 16, …, 32
typedef xint_sat_t<int8_t, 16, 32> custom2_t;
```

### Some notable features

- Saturating signed and unsigned types can be mixed
- Customisable lower and upper bounds

### Usage example

```c++
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdint>
#include "saturating_types.hpp"

uint8_t x[] { 101, 27, 3, 95 };

int main () {
    uint_sat8_t s = 25;

    for (const auto& v : x) {
        s -= v;
    } // s == 0
    s++; // s == 1
    for (const auto& v : x) {
        s *= v;
    }

    volatile unsigned j = s; // s == 255
}
```
